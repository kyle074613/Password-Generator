# Password-Generator

This is a random password generator. It prompts the user for many different criteria to build a random password with, then creates a password using those preferences. The user can choose to create a password with either lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, or any combination of these options! When the password has been generated, the user can click on the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard. 

## Usage
